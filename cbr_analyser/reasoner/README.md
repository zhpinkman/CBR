# Reasoner

This directory contains all the models that we used for our analysis. The models are based on `ELECTRA`, `RoBERTa`, and `BERT`. All of the models have their baseline which are vanilla language models as well as models that have CBR reasoning applied to them. Note that the ones that have `baseline` in their name are the vanilla language models.
