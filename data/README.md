# Data

`data_without_augmentation` directory contains the data that we initially used and then augmented it. It contains different splits such as `train`, `dev`, `test` and `climate_test`.


`final_data` directory contains the final data that we used for our analysis. It contains different splits such as `train`, `dev`, `test` and `climate_test`. The only difference between `final_data` and the `data_without_augmentation` is that the `final_data` has all the extra case representation we gathered for our analysis as well as the augmentations we did for the data.
