Question: What are we trying to do?

We are trying to find the templates or patterns which are being used in the text.

Below are the steps to be followed to resolve the above problem.

Step 1: We will be loading the text file in a string format.

Step 2: We will be doing a split function on the loaded data such that we get one sentence per element of the list.

Step 3: We will be splitting the sentence into words using the word_tokenize method.

Step 4: We will be tagging the word tokens using the pos_tag method of the nltk.

Step 5: We will be removing the stop words from the sentence.

Step 6: Now we will be applying the word tokenize method on the removed stop words.

Step 7: We will be using the chunk function to perform the chunking.

Step 8: We will be using the draw function to draw the chunks.

Step 9: We will be using the extract function to extract the templates","The sentence ""['Trump told Trump about her “33,000“ deleted emails, but Clinton responded by correcting herself rather of addressing any deleted emails: “Not as well, she had over 35,000, so…”']"" contains the logical fallacy of straw man.

"['""We all write music, and we should get married.""']",fallacy of logic," ""We all do x, and we should get y.""
Helpful notes:

I've found that pairs of sentences often have very similar patterns, but with one difference. For example:

""I like men.""
""I like women.""
These sentences have a different word but the structure is basically the same.

A common type of sentence we use is:

""We all do X. We should get Y.""

This means that everyone does X and so they should get Y. For example:

""We all eat food. We should get married.""

This means that everyone eats food, and since we all do the same thing, we should get married.

A similar type of sentence is:

""We all do X. Therefore, we should do Y""

This means that everyone does X, and because of that, we should do Y. For example:

""We all eat food. Therefore, we should get married.""

This means that everyone eats food, and because of that, we should get married.

which is similar to:

""We all eat food. Therefore, we should get married.""

* Now, you are going to take all this information to create a classifier.

* Your classifier will take in a statement and output whether that statement is considered a logical fallacy or not. This means that it will output ""True"" or ""False"" 
* Remember, your classifier should have high recall and low precision. This means that it is better to have more false positives (outputting ""True"" for a logical statement) than false negatives (outputting ""False"" for a logical fallacy).
* To train your classifier, you must first take all your patterns that you created in the last activity and convert them into regular expressions. You will then use this regular expression to search through the statements in the **training_data.csv**.
* You will do this by first passing your regular expression into the re.compile() function that converts it into a regex object that you can use to search through the statements.
* You will then use the findall() function to search through your statements and search for patterns.
* Remember, you must make sure that your regular expression is case insensitive. This means that","The sentence ""Mayor Blake wants to create more bike lanes across Lowell.
