* `sentence_reprsentation_extraction` contains the code for extracting different case representations such as `explanations`, `goals`, `counterarguments`, and `structure` of the arguments. As it uses the OpenAI api and needs the api key, you have to include all the keys in the `config.py` file as a dictionary with the keys being indices starting from 0 and values being the keys.
